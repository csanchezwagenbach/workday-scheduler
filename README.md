# workday-scheduler

## Description
This work day scheduler functions as a straightforward tool that will allow working professionals to organize their days according to their working hours. The application afforded the developer the opportunity to work with dayjs as a means of generating the current time and comparing that curren time against a given professional's inputted schedule.

When the application loads, time blocks in grey have already passed that day, the time block in red represents the present hour, and the time blocks in green represent hours yet still to come. Users may enter into any of these color coded areas and type out what their agenda is for that hour. When a user clicks any of the save buttons to the right of the text areas, all text inside all time blocks will save and remain there upon a user reloading the page. Once a user clears the time blocks and saves that cleared block, then the schedule will clear. Current date and time may be viewed at the top of the page.
